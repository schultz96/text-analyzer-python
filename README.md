# Python Text Analyzer
This is a simple text analyzer that reads a text file and outputs the number of paragraphs, lines, letter counts and other neat details about the text.

## Usage
To use this program, simply run main.py from a command line.
```
python main.py
```

You may change the text file that is analyzed by changing the file name in the main.py file.

The analyzer package contains utility functions split into separate files to help with the analysis. 
The analyze_text_file.py file contains the bulk of the business logic.
